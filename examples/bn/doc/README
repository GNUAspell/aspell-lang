How to Install:

You must have Aspell installed. If Aspell is installed and aspell and 
word-list-compress are all in the path first do a:

  ./configure

Which should output something like:

  Finding Dictionary file location ... /usr/local/lib/aspell
  Finding Data file location ... /usr/local/share/aspell

if it did not something likely went wrong.

After that build the package with:
  make
and then install it with
  make install

If any of the above mentioned programs are not in your path than the
variables, ASPELL and/or WORD_LIST_COMPRESS need to be set to the
commands (with path) to run the utilities.  These variables may be set
in the environment before configure is run or specified at the command
line using the following syntax
  ./configure --vars VAR1=VAL1 ...
Other useful variables configure recognizes are ASPELL_PARMS, and DESTDIR.

To clean up after the build:
  make clean

To uninstall the files:
  make uninstall


How to use:

After the word lists are installed you can use the main one (bn) by
setting the LANG environmental variable to bn or running Aspell
with --lang=bn. However, Aspell will expect your text document to be
in is13194-bn encoding. Unfortunately there are not enough support for this
encoding, however, Aspell is designed to work with only 8Bit encoding and
this is the only 8 bit encoding for Bengali compatible with Unicode. If you
have an UTF-8 encoded text file, you can use the gui program bspeller. It
can be found at:

Creadit:

Needless to say with out Dr. Das's world list we wouldn't have this Bengali
word list for Aspell. My deepest appreciation for his hard work.

Thanks to Kaushik for all his help, and also for infecting our head with the
idea of a Bengali spell checker.

Also special thanks to Kevin Atkinson from Aspell project for all his help.
